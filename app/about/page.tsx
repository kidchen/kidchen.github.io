            I'm Chen, a software engineer living in the Bay Area, originally from China. 
            I'm passionate about backend technologies, distributed systems, and building 
            scalable applications that handle real-world complexity.

            Music has always been a big part of my life. I recently got a digital piano 
            and I'm slowly learning to playâ€”it's harder than it looks! I'm also learning 
            Korean these days, which keeps my brain busy when I'm not coding.

            I'm naturally outgoing and love connecting with people who share similar 
            interests in technology, music, or just life in general. This blog serves 
            as my digital notebook where I share technical insights, document interesting 
            problems I've solved, and occasionally write about non-technical topics 
            that catch my attention.
